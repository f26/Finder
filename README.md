# Finder

A simple GUI-based find utility, written in C# .NET 6.0.  Uses the [ObjectListView](https://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/index.html) control to simplify displaying the results.

This software exists for two reasons:

1) Coding practice
2) The built-in search for Windows has been horrible since Windows 7.  Multiple times it has searched and told me it found nothing when I'm staring at a file in a subdirectory that should clearly match my search text.

The importance of having a simple search utility that does something as basic as *search an entire directory tree* with a no-nonsense GUI is apparently lost on Microsoft.  I don't care about what is indexed.  I don't care about searching file contents.  I don't care about searching the web.  I just want a dumb search program with partial text matching on filenames.  Also I miss Rover.
